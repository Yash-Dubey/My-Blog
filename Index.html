            <h2>My favourite hobby is CODING</h2>
            <h3>I've been interested in technology (mainly computers and other electronics) and programming for quite a while now. I enjoy programming as a hobby very much. Now let me explain - I find programming as a hobby very interesting. I enjoy the problem solving that lies underneath it and I enjoy creating applications (especially Web applications) very time.</h3>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p id="para">When kids are introduced to coding, they gain appreciation of how digital technology work. Digital technology is a big part of many kidsâ€™ lives, as they are surrounded by smart phones, video games, video entertainment, websites, and even robots. What drives this technology are software or computer programs that are created by coding. Like learning about biology and chemistry, it is important for kids to understand the building blocks of an integral part of their life. They need to realize that what happens when they use technology is not magic, and they themselves can create programs that can be useful.</p>
